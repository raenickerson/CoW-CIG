# About

The CoW-CIG (Conservation on Workinglands Conservation Innovation Grant Team) is 
a group of livestock producers, researchers, graduate students, and NGO partners
working together to evaluate the effectiveness of nonlethal tools at reducing 
conflicts between livestock, wolves, and grizzly bears. My work focuses on range 
riding - a tool where riders provide human presence among a livestock herd while
monitoring and managing the activity of livestock and predators. 

This semester project will focus on organizing my database, and visualizing predator presence across camera site locations from our pilot in eastern Washington.
